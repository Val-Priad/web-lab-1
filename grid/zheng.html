        <h1>Zheng</h1>

            preying on man-eating beasts like tigers and
            leopards.</p>
        <img src="../images/mountain_creature.webp"
             alt="mountain creature">
        <h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size</strong>: Zheng is slightly larger
                than an average tiger, with a robust and
                muscular build suited for combat.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tails</strong>: It has five long,
                flowing tails, each with a sharp, blade-like
                tip. The tails are prehensile and can be used
                for both offense and defense.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fur</strong>: Its body is covered in
                sleek, dark fur, usually black or deep grey,
                making it hard to spot in dense forests or at
                night.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Glowing amber or golden
                eyes that give it exceptional night vision,
                helping it detect threats and prey in the
                darkness.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fangs and Claws</strong>: Razor-sharp
                fangs and retractable claws designed to pierce
                the thick hides of predators like tigers or
                leopards.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Markings</strong>: Distinctive luminous
                markings along its body, which may glow faintly
                when it’s hunting or threatened.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Predator Tracker</strong>: Possesses an
                acute sense of smell and heightened senses,
                allowing it to track man-eating beasts from
                miles away.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Agility and Speed</strong>: Despite its
                size, Zheng is incredibly fast and agile,
                capable of outmaneuvering large predators in
                dense environments.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stealth</strong>: Its ability to blend
                into shadows and move silently makes it an
                excellent ambush hunter, catching even the most
                cautious of predators off guard.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tail Control</strong>: Each of its five
                tails can act independently, helping it to
                strike, bind, or disarm multiple foes at once.
                The tails are sharp enough to cut through bone
                and thick fur.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Healing Factor</strong>: It has a rapid
                healing ability, allowing it to recover quickly
                from injuries sustained during battle.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solitary Hunter</strong>: Zheng tends to
                hunt alone, focusing on taking down large,
                dangerous carnivores that threaten human
                settlements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Territorial</strong>: It marks its
                territory fiercely, and other predators, even
                the strongest, tend to avoid areas claimed by
                Zheng.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Protector Role</strong>: Despite its
                fearsome nature, it only targets beasts that
                pose a direct threat to humans, particularly
                those that have developed a taste for human
                flesh.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: Highly
                intelligent and strategic in its attacks, using
                the environment to its advantage, such as luring
                predators into traps or ambushes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Loyalty</strong>: If befriended or
                respected, Zheng is known to be protective of
                certain humans, though this relationship is
                rare.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>
        <ul class="main-window-ul-style">
            <li><strong>Dense Forests and Mountains</strong>:
                Zheng primarily lives in dense forests,
                mountainous regions, and areas where dangerous
                predators lurk. It prefers regions where it can
                easily stalk its prey and use the terrain to its
                advantage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Secluded Caves</strong>: It makes its
                lair in secluded caves or hidden areas where it
                can rest between hunts.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="mythology">Mythology and Significance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legendary Hunter</strong>: In local
                mythology, Zheng is seen as a guardian of
                forests and villages, keeping human populations
                safe from vicious predators.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Symbol of Protection</strong>: It is
                often revered as a symbol of protection and
                strength, with stories passed down of how Zheng
                has saved communities from ravenous beasts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feared but Respected</strong>: While
                feared for its immense power, Zheng is also
                respected and honored by those who understand
                its role in maintaining balance in the wild.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="weakness">Weakness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fire</strong>: Zheng is particularly
                vulnerable to fire, as its fur and markings are
                highly flammable, which forces it to avoid human
                settlements that use fire as protection.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Group Attacks</strong>: Although strong
                against individual predators, Zheng can be
                overwhelmed if faced with coordinated attacks
                from multiple enemies.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Zheng</strong> stands as a formidable
            guardian of the
            wild, renowned for its role in controlling dangerous
            man-eating beasts and ensuring the safety of human
            settlements. With its powerful build, five versatile
            tails, and exceptional hunting skills, Zheng
            represents a blend of strength, agility, and
            strategic prowess. Its stealth and tracking
            abilities make it an adept predator of the most
            fearsome carnivores, while its protective nature
            highlights its role as a defender of the natural
            order.

            In mythology, Zheng is revered as both a protector
            and a symbol of balance, embodying the complex
            interplay between danger and safety in the wild.
            Despite its fearsome reputation, Zheng’s
            vulnerabilities—such as susceptibility to fire and
            challenges in group confrontations—remind us of its
            limits and the delicate balance it maintains in its
            environment. As a creature of both awe and respect,
            Zheng's legacy continues to inspire stories of valor
            and guardianship, underscoring its importance in the
            folklore of the regions it inhabits.</p>
