                        <h1>Jufu</h1>
                        <p>The <strong>Jufu</strong> is a legendary monkey-like
                            creature found in folklore, known for its unique
                            ability to hurl stones with incredible precision and
                            force. This creature's fearsome stone-throwing
                            skills allow it to dominate its environment and
                            intimidate other beasts in its vicinity. Though it
                            is rarely encountered by humans, it has earned a
                            reputation for being a powerful and dangerous figure
                            in the wild.</p>

                        <h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
                        <p>The Jufu is described as resembling a <strong>large
                            monkey or ape</strong> with exaggerated limbs that
                            aid in its stone-throwing prowess. It has a sturdy,
                            muscular frame and long arms, which allow it to
                            gather and throw stones with remarkable speed and
                            accuracy. Its fur is usually dark, ranging from
                            shades of brown to black, and it is known for its
                            sharp, piercing eyes that seem to focus intensely on
                            targets before unleashing its deadly stones.</p>
                        <p>Despite its menacing behavior, the Jufu's face often
                            appears surprisingly calm, even contemplative, as it
                            watches from a distance, selecting the right moment
                            to strike.</p>

                        <h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
                        <p>The Jufu is most famous for its <strong>stone-hurling
                            abilities</strong>, which are central to its
                            identity and legend. However, it has other notable
                            abilities as well:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Long-range precision:</strong> The Jufu
                                can hurl stones with remarkable accuracy over
                                long distances, far beyond the capabilities of
                                any ordinary animal or human.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Great strength:</strong> Beyond its
                                skill in throwing, the Jufu possesses immense
                                physical strength, which allows it to lift and
                                throw large stones with ease.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Tactical intelligence:</strong> The Jufu
                                is known for its cunning and strategy. It uses
                                its surroundings to its advantage, often
                                ambushing its prey or enemies from elevated
                                positions like cliffs or trees.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
                        <p>The Jufu is primarily a <strong>solitary
                            creature</strong>, preferring to live in isolation
                            or in small groups that maintain strict territories.
                            Its territorial nature is one of its most defining
                            traits, and it will fiercely defend its domain from
                            intruders, be they other animals or even larger
                            predators. Rather than engaging in close combat, the
                            Jufu often relies on its superior range and accuracy
                            to repel threats from a distance.</p>
                        <p>When hunting or in conflict, the Jufu prefers to
                            position itself in higher ground, such as on
                            hilltops or treetops, where it can rain down stones
                            on unsuspecting prey or foes below. Its reputation
                            among other animals is one of terror; even larger
                            beasts are known to avoid the Jufu's territory to
                            escape its relentless stone attacks.</p>

                        <h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>
                        <p>The Jufu is typically found in <strong>dense forests,
                            mountainous regions, or rocky landscapes</strong>,
                            where there is plenty of natural material for it to
                            use in its stone-hurling. These environments provide
                            the Jufu with both cover and ammunition, allowing it
                            to blend into the surroundings and ambush
                            unsuspecting creatures or intruders.</p>
                        <p>It tends to reside near areas with plenty of high
                            ground, such as cliffs, hills, or tall trees, which
                            it uses to gain a strategic advantage over its
                            targets. The creature’s habitat is often remote,
                            away from human settlements, which further fuels the
                            mystery surrounding its existence.</p>

                        <h2 id="mythology">Mythology</h2>
                        <p>The Jufu features in a variety of local myths and
                            folktales, often as a creature of fear and power.
                            Legends describe it as a <strong>guardian of the
                                wilderness</strong>, feared by both animals and
                            humans alike. Some stories depict the Jufu as a
                            creature that protects sacred or forbidden areas,
                            using its stone-hurling abilities to keep
                            trespassers away.</p>
                        <p>In other stories, the Jufu serves as a warning to
                            those who disrespect nature, as it is said to target
                            those who disrupt the balance of the wild or
                            encroach upon its territory. While not inherently
                            evil, the Jufu’s actions are often interpreted as
                            brutal, leading to its fearsome reputation.</p>
                        <p>The creature's long-range stone-throwing is sometimes
                            seen as a symbol of <strong>divine
                                retribution</strong> or
                            <strong>punishment</strong> from nature, striking
                            down those who fail to honor the natural world.</p>

                        <h2 id="weakness">Weakness</h2>
                        <p>Despite its immense strength and precision, the Jufu
                            has certain weaknesses that can be exploited:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Limited mobility when throwing:</strong>
                                The Jufu is highly effective at long range but
                                less so in close combat. If an opponent manages
                                to get within its throwing range, it becomes
                                more vulnerable.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Dependence on surroundings:</strong> The
                                Jufu’s strength lies in its ability to use the
                                environment to its advantage. In areas without
                                ample rocks or stones, the Jufu loses its
                                primary weapon.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Solitary nature:</strong> Since the Jufu
                                prefers to live alone or in small groups, it
                                does not have the strength of numbers. Larger,
                                coordinated groups may be able to overpower it
                                if they can avoid its initial barrage of stones.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The <strong>Jufu</strong> remains a unique figure in
                            folklore, a creature that rules its domain through
                            cunning, strength, and the ability to terrify other
                            beasts with its long-range attacks. Known for its
                            stone-hurling prowess and tactical intelligence, the
                            Jufu is a reminder of nature's unpredictability and
                            power, both feared and respected in the myths where
                            it appears. Though it is rarely encountered, its
                            legend endures as a symbol of the raw and untamed
                            forces of the wilderness.</p>
